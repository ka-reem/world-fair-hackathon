# Chrome Extension Icons

For this extension to work properly, you need icon files in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor, or use online tools like:
- https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
- https://www.canva.com/
- Or any image editing software

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon.

## Simple Icon Creation:
1. Create a simple square image with your desired design
2. Save it in different sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Place them in this icons/ folder
4. Make sure the filenames match exactly: icon16.png, icon32.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
