**Query:**
```
Do elephants have good memory?
```

**Response:**
```
Yes, elephants possess excellent memory due to their strong neurological system and the complexity of their cognitive abilities. They are known for their ability to remember information from multiple sources, such as past experiences or training sessions, and they can recall information even after being separated from their owners.

Elephants have been observed practicing memory exercises in captivity, such as associating a sound with a particular location or object. This allows them to retrieve these associations later on when exposed to the same stimulus in natural environments. 

Additionally, studies have shown that elephants can retain information for several weeks or even months, depending on their age and training schedule. The long-term memory of elephants is one of their most impressive cognitive abilities, allowing them to navigate complex social hierarchies, communicate with each other in a nonverbal manner, and maintain relationships with humans over long periods of time.
