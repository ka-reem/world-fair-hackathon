**Query:**
```
Do elephants have good memory?
```

**Response:**
```
Sure, I'd be happy to answer your question! Elephants are known for their strong memories and ability to recall past events. They have been observed re-creating scenes from childhood and learning new skills based on experiences they had in the past. Additionally, elephants can hold onto information for a long time, which could help them to avoid danger or remember important social cues. In general, elephants' memories are considered exceptional compared to those of other animals due to their complex cognitive abilities and the amount of information they process at a single time.
