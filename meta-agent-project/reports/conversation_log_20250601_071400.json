    "response": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy through a series of reactions. The key steps involved in this process are:\n\n1. Light enters the photosystems (also known as chromophores) in a plant or alga, causing them to absorb energy from the sun.\n\n2. The absorbed energy is converted into chemical energy through the process of photoinhibition, where the energy is stored in molecules called photosystem II (PSII).\n\n3. PSII produces two molecules of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which are used to transport the energy up the chain to another enzyme called Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase).\n\n4. Rubisco uses the ATP to split a molecule of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate into glucose and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).\n\n5. Glucose is transported back down the chain and used for cellular energy production or stored",

Here's an overview of what it might look like:\n\nDay 1: Warm-up - Sit on the floor or chair with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Beginners should start by stretching their legs and then gradually increase the pace of their movements, using props such as a towel or chair to help them get into position.\n\nDuration: 15 minutes\n\nDrills: (1) Leg Circles - Start by standing in place with your feet together at shoulder height. Slowly roll backward from your hips, keeping your knees together and your arms straight. Repeat for a total of four circles.\n\n(2) Planks - Lie on your stomach with hands touching or just above the floor. Hold your breath for five seconds, then exhale as you lift your body up until it's in a plank position (hips lifted off the ground). Repeat for a total of four sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n(3) Chest Stretch - Start by standing tall with your feet hip-",
